# Using Marley with Ruby 1.9 and Heroku (2010/10/01)

This is the perex of the test article with explicit date

I'm still relatively new to ruby so I like when I find a project that furthers my ruby education and also accomplishes another project or task that I have wanted to get done. That was the case with setting up this blog. I read Jacob Vorreuter's [post](http://jkvor.com/marley-heroku-blogging) about blogging with marley and heroku and I agreed with the sentiments he expressed.  

For those who are not familiar with [Marley](http://github.com/karmi/marley) it is a small blogging engine that uses Sinatra. Blog entries are crafted in a text editor and can use Markdown syntax.


Play nice with ruby 1.9...

Heroku setup
